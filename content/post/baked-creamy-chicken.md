## Ingredients:

  - 1 kg boneless chicken breast or thighs
  - Vegetables of your choice (carrots, peas, potatoes, beans, broccoli
    etc.)
  - 2 onions - small, finely chopped
  - 1 cup fresh cream
  - 1 cup grated cheese
  - 4 tbsp all-purpose flour (maida)
  - 2 cups milk
  - 1/2 cup melted butter
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tsp crushed black pepper
  - 1 tsp salt

## Method:

Start with blanching the vegetables you wish to use in this dish and
keep aside. Put slits to the chicken pieces and apply olive oil, salt
and black pepper. Keep aside for an hour. Fry chicken pieces in thin
layer of oil till slightly brown on both sides. Keep aside.

Take a wok and add oil. When the oil is warm, add onions. When these are
soft, take the wok off the flame and add butter. Sauté the blanched
vegetables in this.

Take another pan and add remaining butter and sauté the all-purpose
flour on a low flame till you get a slight aroma. (It is important to
keep a vigilant eye on this and to move the spoon through the flour to
make sure that the flour doesn't get burnt). Allow the flour to cool and
then pour it in the milk, mixing well to make sure that there are no
lumps. Put this mixture back in the pan (on low flame) and keep stirring
till it starts thickening.

Now add fried chicken pieces, vegetables, fresh cream, quarter cup
cheese, salt and black pepper. Mix again and pour the contents on to a
greased baking dish. Spread evenly and finally add the remaining grated
cheese as a top layer. Keep the dish in the microwave and heat till the
cheese melts into a brown top layer.
