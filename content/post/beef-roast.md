<!--more-->


##### Ingredients:

  - 1 kg beef tenderloin
  - 4 onions, large, cut in thick rings
  - 2 potatoes, large, cut in thick rings
  - 4 green chillies
  - 2 tbsp black pepper powder
  - ½ tsp turmeric powder
  - 1 tbsp ginger garlic paste
  - 1 tsp mustard paste/sauce
  - 2 tbsp vinegar/lemon juice
  - 1/2 cup cilantro (coriander leaves)
  - 1½ tsp salt
  - 4 tbsp oil
  - 1 cup water

**Whole spices**

  - 4 cloves
  - 3 cinnamon sticks, small
  - 4 dried red chilies
  - 7 black pepper corns
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 1 star anise seed

##### Method:

Marinate chunks of beef with black pepper powder, mustard paste,
turmeric powder, ginger and garlic paste, green chillies, salt and
vinegar (or lemon juice). Keep aside for 2 to 3 hours.

Take a pan on high flame. Add 2 tbsp oil and whole spices. When the red
chillies are slightly burnt, add the marinated beef chunks and keep
stirring on high flame till the color of meat changes from pink to
brown. Add 1 cup water and turn the flame to a very low flame. Cover the
pan and let the meat cook for 30 minutes. Remove the cooked beef and its
stock from the pan and keep aside. Cut them into thin slices, once
slightly cool.

In the same pan, add 2 tbsp oil and fry the potatoes rings. Once done,
remove and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Again in the same oil, fry the
onion rings till transparent. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, add the
fried potato rings and mix and also add the thin slices of beef and mix
well.

Finally, add some chopped cilantro and serve.
