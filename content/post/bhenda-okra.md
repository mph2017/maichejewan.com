  - 2 onions, medium-sized, sliced
  - 2 tomatoes, medium-sized, sliced
  - 2 green chilies, slit in half
  - 1" ginger, chopped fine
  - 8 garlic cloves, crushed

##### Method:

Wash the okras and dry them with a kitchen towel. Cut them in Juliette

Take a pan and add oil and mustard seeds. When the seeds start to

chilies, chopped onions and tomatoes. Add salt, as per taste.

When the onions and tomatoes have softened, add red chilly powder, garam
masala powder, mango powder (or tamarind water), mix and add the cut
okra. Cover the pan for 10 minutes, on medium flame. Garnish with
coriander leaves.
