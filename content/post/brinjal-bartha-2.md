Eggplant (brinjal) bartha
<!--more-->



##### Ingredients:

  - 1 eggplant / brinjal, large
  - 1 onion, large, finely chopped
  - 1 tbsp yogurt
  - 2 green chilies, finely chopped
  - 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
  - 1/2 " ginger, finely chopped
  - 1/2 cup coriander leaves, finely chopped
  - salt to taste

##### Method:

Wash and dry the eggplant with the stem. Next, poke the eggplant at
multiple sites with the fork (this will ensure that the insides of the
eggplant cook well). Place the eggplant whole on a low flame, turning
from time to time until you see a black charred skin coating or a
collapsed skin. (Alternatively, you may place the eggplant in an oven
heated at 250 degrees for about 20 minutes. Be sure to line the oven
surface with foil as the eggplant tends to leak juices during this
process).

Once cooked, leave to cool. Later peel off the loosely attached skin and
stem and empty the mushy insides into a blender. Add the yogurt and
blend into a coarse paste.

Add the finely chopped onion, ginger, garlic, green chilies and salt and
mix. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve.

> A variant of this dish, often cooked in the north of India, is by
> adding powdered spices and cooking on a pan in some oil.
