Burger Chilly Fry
<!--more-->

01 May 2017

##### Ingredients:

  - 5 pieces burgers, chicken or beef
  - 2 onions, medium-sized, sliced thinly
  - 2 tomatoes, medium-sized, sliced thinly
  - 2 green chillies, slit in half
  - 1 tsp ginger, chopped fine
  - 1 tsp garlic, chopped fine
  - ¼ tsp turmeric powder
  - ½ tsp red Kashmir chilly powder
  - ½ tsp garam masala powder
  - 2 tbsp coriander leaves
  - 1 tbsp lemon juice
  - 2 tbsp cooking oil
  - ½ cup water
  - salt, as per taste

##### Method:

In a non-stick pan on a low flame, cook the burgers on both sides. You
don’t need to add any oil at this stage, as the meat tends to lose its
own juices and fat. Once cooked julienne the burgers and keep aside.

In the same pan, add the oil, green chilies and sliced onions and sauté
slightly. Then, add tomatoes, salt and turmeric powder. Mix and cover
the pan till the onions and tomatoes are soft. Now, add the red kashmir
chilly powder, garam masala and mix. Add the julienne burgers, 1/2 cup
water and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, checking
to see that the burger and the mix doesn’t dry out. Give the salt a last
check and finally add lemon juice and coriander leaves.
