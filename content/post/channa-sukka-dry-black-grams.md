Channa sukka (dry black grams)
<!--more-->


##### Ingredients:

  - 1/4 kg, bengal gram, soaked overnight
  - 2 onions, medium-sized, minced
  - 2 tomatoes, medium-sized, minced
  - 3 green chillies, slit in half
  - 1/2" ginger, minced
  - 1 tsp, mustard seeds
  - 9 garlic cloves, crushed
  - 2 tbsp, palm jaggery, grated
  - 1 cup, fresh coconut, grated
  - 4 tbsp, cooking oil
  - 2 tsp, bafat powder
  - salt, as per taste

> 1 tsp red chilly powder and 1/2 tsp garam masala can be used to
replace bafat powder.

##### Method:

Soak the bengal grams in water overnight. On the following day, drain
and wash. Put these in the pressure cooker with water at a height of 1
1/2 inches above the grams. Cook on medium flame till the cooker lets
off 4 to 5 whistles. Remove from flame and keep aside.

In a wok, add oil. When the oil is warm, add mustard seeds. As these
start crackling, add curry leaves and crushed garlic cloves till you get
the aroma of the garlic. Now, add minced ginger, green chilies, onions,
tomatoes and salt. Mix well and cover with lid, cooking on a low flame
till the onions and tomatoes are soft.

Now add bafat powder along with grated jaggery and the boiled bengal
grams. Add the grated coconut, mix and cook with lid on for another five
minutes.

The dish is now ready to be served.
