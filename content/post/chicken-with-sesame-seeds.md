Chicken with Sesame seeds
<!--more-->


##### Ingredients :

  - ½ kg chicken, boneless cubes
  - 1/2 cup scallion (spring onion), cut fine
  - 1 tbsp ginger and garlic paste
  - 1 tsp black pepper powder
  - ½ tsp turmeric powder
  - ½ tsp red chilly powder
  - 2 tbsp corn starch powder
  - 2 tsps sesame seeds
  - 1 tbsp lemon juice
  - 1 tsp salt
  - oil for deep frying

**Sauces**

  - 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
  - 2 tbsp chilly garlic
  - 1 tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 tsp hot sauce
  - 2 tbs honey

##### Method:

Marinate the boneless chicken cubes with ginger and garlic paste,
turmeric powder, black pepper powder, red chilly powder, lemon juice and
salt. Keep in the refrigerator overnight.

The next day, heat the oil you will use to **deep fry** the chicken.
Drain any water released from the marinated chicken. Add corn starch to
the chicken cubes and mix well.

When the [oil is
heated](http://noshon.it/tips/4-ways-to-test-if-your-oil-is-hot-enough-for-frying/),
fry the chicken cubes until golden brown and keep aside.

On a separate medium flame, take a wok and toast the sesame seeds.
(*Toasting the sesame seeds: spread the sesame seeds out in an even
layer and cook while stirring the seeds constantly to toast them evenly
and prevent burning; this could take about 5 minutes*).

Add the sauces to the wok and mix in the fried chicken cubes. Mix well
and garnish with scallion and serve hot.

*To **deep fry** means to fry the ingredient fully submerged or with the
oil covering it completely*.
