  - 1/2 cup, fresh coconut, grated
  - 3 green chillies, slit in half
  - 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
  - 4 garlic cloves, chopped
  - 1/2" ginger, chopped
  - 4-5 curry leaves
  - 3 tbsp oil
  - salt, as per taste

##### Method:

Take a pan, place all the above ingredients with the oil and salt. Cook
for ten minutes on a low flame, until beans are soft.
