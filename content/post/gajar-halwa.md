## Ingredients

  - 5 cups, grated carrots
  - 2 1/2 cups, sugar
  - 3 tbsp, milk powder
  - 1 tsp, cardamom powder
  - 1 1/2 tbsp, butter
  - almond/pistachio flakes (for garnishing)

## Method

In a pressure cooker, add the grated carrots, sugar and milk powder. Mix
well till a wet sugar syrup is seen. Now close the pressure cooker and
place the whistle, cooking on medium heat. Allow the whistle to go off
twice and then switch the heat off, letting the cooker cool down.

After the cooker is relatively cooler (no more sounds of pressure from
inside / not too hot to touch), open the cooker, add butter and cardamom
powder and mix. Keep the cooker back on medium heat, stirring
continuously till the mixture dries in.

Grease a tray or plate and dish out the carrot halwa in it. Garnish with
almonds and pistachio flakes.

Can be served hot or chilled.

*Whole milk may be used instead of milk powder. However, this doesn't
work best as the moisture from the carrots, sugar and this adds up to
the volume of liquid that later needs to be dried off*.
