*Yet another quick dish...these are especially for those times when
guests come in uninvited or youâ€™ve had enough of the chicken or meat.
Boneless fish is the best pick for this one*

## Ingredients :

  - 1 kg fish of your choice, preferably boneless; cut in cubes
  - 1 green bell pepper, diced
  - 1 1/2" ginger; cut fine
  - 2 pods garlic; cut in thin slices
  - 2 onions, medium-sized; diced with petals separated
  - 3-4 stems scallion; cut fine
  - 2 green chillies; slit in half
  - 1 cup yoghurt
  - 1 tbsp ginger and garlic paste
  - 1/2 tsp turmeric powder (*haldi*)
  - 1 tsp mixed herbs
  - 1/4 tsp oregano
  - oil to fry
  - salt to taste

**Sauces**

  - 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
  - 1 tsp soy sauce

## Method:

Keep the oil you will use to deep fry for heating. Marinade the fish
with ginger and garlic paste, turmeric powder, yoghurt and a little
salt. Deep fry this fish and keep aside.

In a separate pan, take 3 tbsp oil and fry the green chillies and onion
petals. When the petals turn transparent, add the ginger and garlic
slices. Stir fry and add the bell pepper.

Mix well, add the sauces and the fried fish. Again mix well and garnish
with the scallion. Serve hot.
