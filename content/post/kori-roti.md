## Ingredients:

  - 1 kg chicken (cut into medium sized pieces)
  - 2 big onions (cut into fine slices)
  - 2 green chillies
  - 9 garlic cloves (crushed)
  - 1/2" ginger
  - 1 can coconut cream
  - 1 tbsp yogurt
  - 1 tomato medium-sized
  - 1 chicken soup cube
  - 1 mug water

### Powders:

  - 3 tsp red chilly powder
  - 2 tsp coriander (dhanya) powder
  - 1 tsp cumin (jeera) powder
  - 1/2 tsp turmeric (haldi) powder

### Whole spices:

  - 9 black pepper corns
  - 5 cloves
  - 2-3 cinnamon sticks
  - a pinch of fennel seeds
  - 1 small cardamom \*1/2 tsp mustard seeds

## Method:

Cut the chicken into medium-sized pieces and bring to a boil (on a
medium flame) with the water and chicken soup cube along with some whole
spices. (You may add potatoes cut in small cubes, if you like potatoes
in your curry). Switch the flame off when the potatoes are almost done
or chicken half done and keep aside.

Broil the onions, green chillies, crushed garlic and ginger on a low
fire. Add the three powders, broiling further for a few minutes before
you remove all contents on to a plate.

Saute the whole spices and add all this with the broiled ingredients
kept aside and grind to a paste with the coconut cream, yogurt and
tomato.

Add the ground masala to the above boiled chicken, add water for  
the required consistency of curry (add more water if you like a thinner
curry) and salt as per taste. Boil till the chicken is done. Garnish
with fried brown onions.

This curry is best eaten with a flat rice bread that is called Kori
roti. The flat bread is broken into pieces and curry poured over.
