Kulkuls(Kedios)
<!--more-->



## Ingredients

- 500 grams, all purpose flour (maida)
- 200g, castor sugar
- 200g, coconut milk
- 1tbsp, butter
- 1 pinch, nutmeg powder
- 1 tsp, vanilla essence
- salt, as per required
- 500g, ghee, to deep fry 

## Method

Take a bowl and add all the ingredients (except the oil) and knead them to make the dough. Keep aside to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Make tiny marble size balls and keep aside.

To make the kulkul, apply oil on both the sides of the fork / comb (new and unused), take one ball and press it on the fork, covering the prongs of the fork with your thumb. Rolle the dough upwards, folding it on itself, so the kulkul is formed in the shape of a worm (in other words *kedios*). Arrange these on a plate or tray dusted with flour so that the kulkuls do not stick to each other. Repeat this till all the dough balls are done and keep aside.

Take a deep kadai (wok) with ghee to deep fry the kulkuls. When the ghee is hot, put one or two kulkuls in the ghee to check if the oil is at an optimum temperature. You know the oil is ready to be used, when the kulkuls rise as soon as they have been put into the oil.

Put a few kulkuls slowly into the kadai and keep on medium flame, letting them fry them by frequently tossing them in the oil till golden brown. When this colour, remove them and let to cool for 4-5 hours on a kitchen towel. Once cool, store them in an airtight container.

*You may coat the kulkuls with castor sugar once cool to give them a sweeter touch*
