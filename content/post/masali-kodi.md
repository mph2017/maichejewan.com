## Ingredients: (Serves 4-5 persons)

  - 1 kg fish of your choice

## For the paste:

  - 2 onions, medium-size
  - 2 tsps red chilly Powder
  - 2 tsp coriander powder
  - 1 tsp cumin powder
  - 1 green chilly
  - 7 garlic cloves
  - 1 tomato - large / 1 tbsp curd
  - 7 Vonti Solan (dried Monkey Jack seeds) / Tamarind (size of a lemon)
  - 7-8 curry leaves
  - 1/2 freshly grated coconut / 1 can coconut milk
  - Salt to taste

## For the pan:

  - 1 onion - small-sized; finely sliced
  - 2 green chillies - slit in half
  - 1/2 inch ginger - finely chopped
  - 2 tbsp oil
  - 1/2 cup coriander leaves - finely chopped to garnish

## Method:

Grind all above ingredients to a fine paste.

Take a cooking pan on a medium-sized flame. Once hot, add oil, a few
curry leaves, sliced onion, slit green chillies and ginger and saute
till you are able to smell the aroma.

Add the ground paste, saute, and add water according to the consistency
you prefer (the curry is usually served thick). When it comes to a boil,
add the washed and cut fish pieces and cook for around 10 mins. This is
usually all the time you need to cook the fish.

Garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with steamed rice.
