chopped green chilies, onions, tomatoes and some salt. Cover with a lid
and keep on a low flame till the onions and tomatoes turns soft. Now
add chopped ginger and garlic and mix well. When you start to get the
aroma of the cooked onions, add black pepper, salt or soup cube (either
one, as soup cubes already contain salt).

Add the marinated mince and keep stirring till the meat it has changed
color from pink to a more dull colour, make sure it is mixed well with
no lumps in the mixture.

Now add black pepper powder, garam masala, turmeric powder and potato
cubes. Mix and cover with lid, cooking on low flame for another 10 to 15
mins or till the potatoes are done.

*Bafat powder is a Mangalorean spice mix. In the absence of this masala,
you may add any curry flavour masala you prefer. Mince cooked this way
is best eaten with *"pav"* which is a soft bread roll, usually square in
shape.
