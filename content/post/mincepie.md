## Ingredients:

  - 1/2 kg, chicken / mutton mince
  - 2 onions, medium, finely chopped
  - 3 potatoes, large, boiled and mashed
  - 1/2 tomato paste/puree
  - 1 tbsp. yoghurt
  - 1 tsp. ginger and garlic, chopped
  - 3 green chillies, finely chopped
  - 1 bunch, coriander leaves, chopped
  - 12 mint leaves, chopped
  - 1 tsp. garam masala powder
  - 2 tsp. red chilli powder
  - 1/2 tsp. turmeric powder
  - 1 tsp. pepper, ground
  - 1 tbsp. lemon juice
  - salt, as per taste
  - 1 tbsp. butter
  - 2 tbsp. oil

## Whole spices:

  - 5 cloves
  - 2 cinnamon sticks, small
  - 8 pepper corns
  - 1 star anise

## Method:

Marinate the meat mince with ginger garlic paste, salt, turmeric powder,
1/2 tsp. ground pepper and yoghurt. Mix and keep aside for half an hour.

Boil potatoes, cool, peel skin and mash into a smooth paste (without
lumps). Add butter, 1/2 tsp. pepper powder, salt (if you are using
salted butter in the mashed potatoes, do not add salt here) and mix
well.

Then, take a wok, add oil and full spices and cook marinated mince on
high flame. When the meat changes colour with a strong aroma, add
chopped ginger garlic and green chillies. Stir well and add chopped
onions, tomato paste, red chilly powder, salt and mix well. Cover the
wok and cook on low flame until the mince is cooked, without drying out
all the liquid in the meat. Once cooked, add garam masala, lemon juice,
coriander leaves, mint leaves mix well and keep to cool.

Take a baking dish and grease it with the butter, put 1/4 of mashed
potato and spread it evenly. Now put the cooked mince on it and spread
out evenly. Layer out the remaining mashed potatoes over the mince (Tip:
Wet a steel spoon to spread the potatoes so that the potato doesn't
stick to the spoon).

Preheat the oven to 180°C, place the baking dish in and and bake till
the top layer of potatoes turns light brown.
