## Ingredients

- 1 Kg, pork Chops
- 1 tsp, ginger paste
- 1 tsp, garlic paste
- 1 tsp, turmeric powder
- 1 tsp, bafat powder
- whole spices (	5 cloves, 7-8 black pepper corns, 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 cardamom, 2 bay leaves)
- sauces (1tbsp BBQ sauce, 2 tbsp chilly garlic sauce, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp vinegar, 1 tsp lemon juice or 1 tbsp yoghurt, 2 tbsp honey, 1tbsp olive oil)	
- salt, as per taste
- 2 tbsp, oil

## Method

Mix all the ingredients for the sauce and keep aside. Marinate the chops with the ginger garlic paste and keep refrigerated overnight.

To cook, take a pan add 2 tablespoon of oil and add full spices. When you get the aroma of the spices, add marinated chops and fry on high flame until you see the meat change colour from red to brown. Toss the chops and fry. Once mostly done, put the flame on low, cover the pan and cook till the chops are done.

After the chops are cooked, pour the mixed sauces and stir well till each chop is coated with sauce. Do this on a high flame and serve.

*Tip: It is always good to marinate the meat of any kind overnight and cook the next day. Try to use yoghurt for marinating, instead of vinegar or lime juice*
