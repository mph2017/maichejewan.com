## Ingredients

- 2 cups, ragi (finger millet flour)
- 1 cup, rice flour
- 2 tbsp cooked rice
- 2½ cup, jaggery, grated
- ½ tsp, cardamom powder
- a pinch of nutmeg powder
- 1 tsp, butter
- salt, as per taste 

**Method:**

Grind all the above ingredients (except cardamom and nutmeg powder) with water and make a thick batter like dosa/pancake batter. Add the cardamom and nutmeg powder, mix and check the sweetness, to see if you’d like to add more jaggery. 

Also check the consistency of batter, it should be thick. Now add 1tsp butter and put this batter in the greased dish and cook in the preheated steamer for 45 mins to a hour.

To check if cooked, poke a thin knife or a toothpick in the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, this means it is done; if the batter sticks to the knife or toothpick, let it cook for some more time. Once done,  let it cool and cut into slices and serve.
