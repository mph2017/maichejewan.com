## Ingredients

- 2 cups, maida (all-purpose flour)
- ¼ cup, rava (semolina, fine)
- 1 cup, castor sugar
- 1 pinch, baking soda
- ½ tsp, vanilla essence
- 2 cups, water, to make sugar syrup
- salt, as per taste
- 2tbsp, ghee
- 500g, ghee, for frying

## Method

Take a pan and add 2 cups of water and 1 cup sugar and boil to make a thin syrup and keep aside to cool.

Take a big bowl and put the maida, rava, baking soda, salt, 2 tbsp of warm ghee, vanilla essence and mix well. Now add the syrup, a little at a time and knead into a dough. Cover the dough with wet muslin cloth and let it rest for 10 mins.

Now take a handful of dough and make a ball and roll to make a circular form, like that of a chapatti. With a pastry wheel, cut the flattened dough into diamond shapes. Next, take a kadai (wok) with the ghee and heat for deep frying. Keep the flame at a medium level and fry thukdio till golden brown. 

Once fried, remove on the kitchen towel. Allow this to cool well for about 3 to 4 hours and then store in an airtight container.
