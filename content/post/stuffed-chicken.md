## Ingredients:

  - 1.5 kg, chicken
  - Whole spices (1 tsp coriander seeds, 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 7 black
    pepper corns, 1 tsp black mustard seeds, 3 cardamom, 7-8 cloves, 1/2
    tsp fennel seeds, 4 red chilli peppers, 3 bay leaves)
  - 3 eggs, boiled, cut in halves
  - 1 tbsp cooking oil

**Marinade**

  - 2 tsp ginger & garlic paste
  - 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
  - 2 tsp red Kashmir chilly powder
  - 3/4 tsp garam masala
  - 1 1/2 tsp salt

**Stuffing**

  - 3 chicken frankfurters, minced
  - 3-4 bacon slices, minced
  - 1/4 kg, mutton mince, cooked
  - 7-8 mushrooms, minced
  - 2 onions, medium-sized, minced
  - 2-3 green chillies, finely cut
  - 4-5 garlic cloves, minced
  - 4 tbsp mixed nuts, crushed (almonds, pistachio, pine nuts)
  - 1/2 cup, parsley, minced
  - 1/2 cup coriander leaves, minced
  - 2 tbsp bread crumbs
  - 2 tbsp lemon juice

## Method:

Clean and dry the chicken (skin on). Marinade with the above marinating
ingredients; keep aside or in the refrigerator overnight.

When ready to cook, take a wok and add oil and half of the whole spices.
Add all of the ingredients for stuffing, one by one, while continuing to
sauté. Add salt and sauté for a further 7 minutes. Finally add crushed
nuts, chopped parsley and coriander leaves, bread crumbs and lemon
juice. Mix well and keep aside to cool.

Once cool, put the stuffing into the marinated chicken and stitch the
chicken cavity up so that stuffing does not come out while roasting and
turning the chicken.

Take a broad pan, add oil and the remaining whole spices. When the
chilies are slightly brown, place the stuffed chicken (on its legs) into
the pan and keep stirring or turning the chicken clockwise, on a high
flame for 2 - 3 minutes.

Now turn the chicken on its back or the side of the breasts and continue
to turn on a high flame for another 2 to 3 minutes. Lower the flame. Add
some water in the remaining marinating mix and pour this on to the
chicken. Cover the pan and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, till the chicken
is done.

Remove on to the serving dish with the remaining stuffing on the sides
of the chicken. Garnish with boiled eggs cut into half.
