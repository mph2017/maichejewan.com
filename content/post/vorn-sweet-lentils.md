## Ingredients:

  - 1 1/2 cup, mung dal (yellow lentils, split)
  - 2 cups, coconut milk
  - 7 cups, water
  - 1 cup, palm jaggery (cane-sugar), dark brown, grated
  - 1 cup, palm jaggery, light brown
  - 1 1/2 tsp, cardamom powder
  - 2 tbsp, rice flour
  - 1 tsp, almonds, pistachio and cashew nuts, flakes
  - 1 tbsp, almonds, pistachio and cashew nuts, coarsely ground
  - 1 tbsp, raisins
  - 1/2 tsp, salt (optional)

## Method:

Soak mung dal in three cups water for an hour. Dilute one cup of
coconut milk in 2 cups of water and cook the soaked dal on medium
flame, till very soft. The dal is cooked enough if it is easily mashed
when pressed against the wall of the pan.

Add both the types of jaggery with the salt (salt should only be added
if the jaggery doesn't already contain any salt). Let this mixture boil
till jaggery melts.

Now add coarsely ground nuts and raisins and let boil for 5 minutes.
When the mixture is boiling keep to a low flame and stir to make sure
the mixture doesn't stick to the base of the pan.

Add the rice flour to 2 cups of water to make a thin paste. Add this
paste, small portions at a time, and keep stirring to make it sure there
are no lumps.

Add the cardamom powder and finally add a cup of coconut milk. Continue
a small boil for another 2-3 minutes, garnish with flakes of dried nuts
and serve.

Vorn is usually served hot but tastes equally amazing when serve
chilled.

>If the Vorn is too thick for you, add skimmed milk to meet the
consistency you like.
